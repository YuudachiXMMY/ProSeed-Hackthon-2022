Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

For previous works:
1.  Change Generic Label in Graph from L to E, N to T
    and in Graph.Edge from L to E, D to T for the majority of
    other Java programmer to read and understand. For I used
    to know the idea of generics but I don't have the common
    idea to us Label like E and T instead of N I used for Node,
    D for Destination, and E for Edge.
2.  I think there's no need to change other previous assignments,
    for I've already consider generic while working on those
    previous weeks.
