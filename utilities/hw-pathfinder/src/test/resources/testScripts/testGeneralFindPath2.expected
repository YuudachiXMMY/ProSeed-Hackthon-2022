# Test Dijkstra's Algorithm to find a shortest path result

created graph graph

added node A  to graph
added node B to graph
added node C to graph
added node D to graph

added edge 114.514 from A  to D in graph
added edge 114.000 from A  to B in graph
added edge 514.000 from B to C in graph
added edge 114.514 from C to D in graph

path from A  to D:
A to D with weight 114.514
total cost: 114.514
