# Test to adding a node with only one edge, which points to the node itself

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node to graph
added node node1 to graph1

# Add an edge to graph
added edge edge1 from node1 to node1 in graph1

# Print all nodes in graph
graph1 contains: node1
the children of node1 in graph1 are: node1(edge1)
