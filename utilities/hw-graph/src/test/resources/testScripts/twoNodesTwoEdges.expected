# Test to add two nodes with edges between them

# Create a graph
created graph graph2

# Add two nodes to graph
added node node1 to graph2
added node node2 to graph2

# Add two edges to graph
added edge edge1 from node1 to node2 in graph2
added edge edge2 from node2 to node1 in graph2

# Print all nodes in graph
graph2 contains: node1 node2
the children of node1 in graph2 are: node2(edge1)
the children of node2 in graph2 are: node1(edge2)
