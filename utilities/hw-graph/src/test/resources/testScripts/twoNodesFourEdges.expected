# Test to add two nodes to graph and add edges that is between them and points to themselves

# Create a graph
created graph graph2

# Add two nodes to graph
added node node1 to graph2
added node node2 to graph2

# Add edges to graph
added edge edge1 from node1 to node1 in graph2
added edge edge2 from node1 to node2 in graph2
added edge edge3 from node2 to node2 in graph2
added edge edge4 from node2 to node1 in graph2

# Print all nodes in graph
graph2 contains: node1 node2
the children of node1 in graph2 are: node1(edge1) node2(edge2)
the children of node2 in graph2 are: node1(edge4) node2(edge3)
